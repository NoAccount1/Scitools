# Coding guidelines

| Element  | Case       |
| ---      | ---        |
| Class    | PascalCase |
| Variable | snake_case |
| Function | camelCase  |

Every text element is supposed to be defined in a language file located in [`src/lang`](/src/lang/) based on [`template.h`](/src/lang/template.h)

If you see any error in my code don't hesitate to report it or create a pull request
